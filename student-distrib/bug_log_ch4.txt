	Checkpoint 1:
		Bug: Assembly couldn't access the 4MB-size kernel
		Solution: Set the PSE (Page Size Extension) value in CR4 to 1
		
		Bug: Assembly still didn't initialize paging properly
		Solution: Set the PE (Protection Enable) value in CR0 to 1 along with PG (Paging) to enable paging
		
		Bug: Segmentation fault when attempting to call a print function after initialize_page()
		Solution: Properly truncate the pointer value of table_entry_array in directory_entry_array.p_table_addr
